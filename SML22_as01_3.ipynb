(Answers like 'No' or 'x=27.2' by themselves are not sufficient, even when they are the result of running your code.) If an exercise requires coding, explain briefly what the code does (in comments). All figures should have titles (descriptions), axis labels, and legends (if applicable).\n",

    "1. Polynomial curve fitting (50 points);\n",
    "2. Gradient descent (25 points);\n",
    "3. __Fruit boxes (25 points);__\n",
    "4. Probability factorization (BONUS 10 points);\n",

Of course you are free to import further libraries, if required, in the allotted cells. **Please avoid installing new packages, unless really necessary.

The piece of fruit is returned and then once again from the *same* box a second piece is chosen at random. This is known as sampling with replacement.

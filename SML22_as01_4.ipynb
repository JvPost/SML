(Answers like 'No' or 'x=27.2' by themselves are not sufficient, even when they are the result of running your code.) If an exercise requires coding, explain briefly what the code does (in comments). All figures should have titles (descriptions), axis labels, and legends (if applicable).\n",

    "Assignment 1 consists of:\n",
    "1. Polynomial curve fitting (50 points);\n",
    "2. Gradient descent (25 points);\n",
    "3. Fruit boxes (25 points);\n",
    "4. __Probability factorization (BONUS 10 points);__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the basic libraries necessary to develop this assignment. Of course you are free to import further libraries, if required, in the allotted cells. **Please avoid installing new packages, unless really necessary. Keep in mind that they will be installed in your \"home-directory\" folder, which has limited diskspace available.**"
